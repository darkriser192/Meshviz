# Meshviz - Mesh Processing Toolkit for Additive Manufacturing
---
## Current Technical State

**Rendering Pipeline Status:**
- **Shader System**: Basic vertex/fragment with projection matrix and color uniforms working
- **Buffer Architecture**: VBO + EBO indexed rendering successfully implemented
- **Mesh Support**: Tetrahedron and cube rendering confirmed, triangle/circle generators added
- **Color System**: Uniform colors via `Mesh.solid_color` property integrated with OpenGL
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Flexible mesh switching via `RENDER_MESH` variable, comprehensive logging

**Known Working Code Patterns:**
- Mesh creation: `shp.create_tetrahedron(0.75)` and `shp.create_cube(0.75)` 
- GPU index upload: Use `facets.size` for total indices (NOT `num_facets` which is triangle count)
- Color rendering: `glUniform4fv(color_loc, 1, RENDER_MESH.solid_color)`
- Buffer management: `glGenBuffers(1)` returns single ID, bind before data upload

**Current Limitations:**
- Static camera view (orthographic projection only)
- No mouse interaction or camera controls
- Circle and cylinder facet generation incomplete
- Transform class methods are stubs (conversion functions not implemented)

## Key Architecture Decisions

**EBO vs Flattened Rendering:** Chose EBO for 73% memory savings on target 1M+ triangles, better GPU cache efficiency
**Numpy vs PyGLM:** Staying with numpy for AM/scientific ecosystem compatibility, proven workflow
**uint32 Facets:** Memory efficiency choice since no negative indices possible in mesh topology
**solid_color Property:** Simple mesh-wide coloring strategy before implementing sparse vertex colors
**Dual Transform Representation:** Matrix for performance, symbolic for precision (robotics insight)
**Phase-based Development:** Rendering first to validate architecture, then file I/O, then spatial algorithms

**Color Rendering Architecture:**
- **Uniform Location Caching:** Extract uniform locations once at startup, update values based on rendering mode
- **Multi-Mode Color System:** Support individual mesh colors, global color override, and dynamic normal-based coloring
- **Performance-Conscious Updates:** Different update frequencies per mode (setup once, per-frame, per-mesh)
- **Mode Switching Strategy:** Hard-coded mode selection (restart to change) transitioning to GUI-based controls

**Rendering Mode Types:**
1. **Individual Colors:** Each mesh uses its `solid_color` property (rare updates)
2. **Global Override:** All meshes use single color, can vary by object type (frame-level updates)
3. **Dynamic Normals:** Per-facet coloring based on weighted vertex normals (per-frame for moving objects)

## Known Issues & Debugging Notes

**Common OpenGL Mistakes (Already Fixed):**
- Using `num_facets` instead of `facets.size` in glDrawElements causes incomplete rendering
- `glGenBuffers(2)` returns array, `glGenBuffers(1)` returns single ID - use correct form
- Must set uniforms AFTER `glUseProgram()` and inside render loop for state consistency

**Debug Patterns That Work:**
- Set `DEBUG = True` for detailed logging of buffer uploads and GPU state
- Use `RENDER_MESH` variable to quickly switch between test objects
- Vertex/index count logging helps validate data flow: "8 vertices, 36 indices"

**Geometry Gotchas:**
- Circle facets need center vertex + circumference triangulation (documented pattern)
- Cube facet winding intentionally left as-is for normal debugging
- Transform class has multiple representations but conversion methods not implemented

---
## Code Organization Standards

**Naming Conventions Established:** 
- Private geometry generators: `_generate_*_geometry()` (returns vertices, facets)
- Public factory functions: `create_*()` (returns Mesh objects)
- Update methods: `update_*()` for in-place modifications of Mesh properties
- Class methods: `from_*()` for alternative Mesh constructors

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- Mesh validation in `__init__()` with clear ValueError/IndexError messages
- OpenGL state logging when `DEBUG=True` for runtime debugging
- Shape validation at geometry generation level

**Memory Management:**
- Consistent numpy dtypes: float64 for vertices, uint32 for facets, float32 for colors
- Copy=False for GPU uploads to avoid unnecessary memory allocation
- Preallocated arrays for normals, areas, centers (lazy computation)

## Performance Testing Context

**Current Testing Scale:** 
- Tetrahedron: 4 vertices, 4 triangles, 12 indices

## Agent Context

** Purpose of this Document:**
The intention of the Project Design Document is to radily transfer infomration between diferent agent instances as well as track the overall development plan. This should be a living document updated by the agent and the user.
The agent should read the document at the begining of every development session and help update it at the end of every development session to keep good track of project goals and progress.
If more context should be added to better transfer work between sessions or agents it should be added as needed.

**Working with This User:**
This user is an AM industry professional with advanced technical knowledge (robotics, thermal modeling, signal processing). They have ADHD and explicitly prefer guided exploration over direct solutions. Key approach:

- **Guide, don't solve**: Ask targeted questions to help them think through problems. They want to implement solutions themselves and return for optimization/criticism
- **Challenge assumptions constructively**: They appreciate when you question their approach or suggest alternatives, but frame as exploration ("What if...?" "Have you considered...?")
- **Match technical sophistication**: They understand Nyquist sampling, affine transforms, robotics kinematics, etc. Don't oversimplify, but do help structure complex decisions
- **Clarify hidden concepts**: They often have ideas "floating in their head" that need extraction and formalization
- **Users programing background:** The user understands high level coding concepts but has limited exposure to actual code and program development. A shortcoming coming from their self-taught background
- **Learning Goals:** The user utilizes this project as a way to develop their practical programing knowledge. Guide them through the documentation and help solve erros and bugs. Don't jump to wiritng the code instead help them learn it.

**Project Context Established:**
- **Priority Philosophy**: Rendering pipeline first to validate architecture, then file I/O, then spatial algorithms
- **Transform Architecture**: Dual representation approach (numeric for performance, symbolic for precision) with dependency tracking
- **Degeneracy Detection**: Multi-tier system based on Nyquist principles - this is production-grade, not academic
- **Performance Targets**: 1M+ triangles, eventual C++/Cython migration, GPU acceleration
- **Domain Applications**: Support generation, collision detection, thermal simulation, haptic feedback

**Technical Decisions Made:**
- Mesh class with lazy computation and sophisticated degeneracy detection
- Array-of-structures approach for transforms (informed by robotics messaging experience)
- Orbit camera with separate pan/zoom/rotate controls (NX/3DXpert style)
- Mesh-wide default color initially, sparse vertex colors later
- Phase-based development with clear completion criteria

**Communication Style:**
- Asks for "housecleaning" when they sense architectural misalignment
- Values documentation that enables context switching between Claude instances
- Appreciates when you identify gaps between implementation and design intent
- Wants to understand trade-offs and implications, not just get working code
