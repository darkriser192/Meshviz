## Agent Context

** Purpose of this Document:**
The intention of the Project Design Document is to radily transfer infomration between diferent agent instances as well as track the overall development plan. This should be a living document updated by the agent and the user.
The agent should read the document at the begining of every development session and help update it at the end of every development session to keep good track of project goals and progress.
If more context should be added to better transfer work between sessions or agents it should be added as needed.

**Working with This User:**
This user is an AM industry professional with advanced technical knowledge (robotics, thermal modeling, signal processing). They have ADHD and explicitly prefer guided exploration over direct solutions. Key approach:

- **Guide, don't solve**: Ask targeted questions to help them think through problems. They want to implement solutions themselves and return for optimization/criticism
- **Challenge assumptions constructively**: They appreciate when you question their approach or suggest alternatives, but frame as exploration ("What if...?" "Have you considered...?")
- **Match technical sophistication**: They understand Nyquist sampling, affine transforms, robotics kinematics, etc. Don't oversimplify, but do help structure complex decisions
- **Clarify hidden concepts**: They often have ideas "floating in their head" that need extraction and formalization
- **Users programing background:** The user understands high level coding concepts but has limited exposure to actual code and program development. A shortcoming coming from their self-taught background
- **Learning Goals:** The user utilizes this project as a way to develop their practical programing knowledge. Guide them through the documentation and help solve erros and bugs. Don't jump to wiritng the code instead help them learn it.

**Project Context Established:**
- **Priority Philosophy**: Rendering pipeline first to validate architecture, then file I/O, then spatial algorithms
- **Transform Architecture**: Dual representation approach (numeric for performance, symbolic for precision) with dependency tracking
- **Degeneracy Detection**: Multi-tier system based on Nyquist principles - this is production-grade, not academic
- **Performance Targets**: 1M+ triangles, eventual C++/Cython migration, GPU acceleration
- **Domain Applications**: Support generation, collision detection, thermal simulation, haptic feedback

**Technical Decisions Made:**
- Mesh class with lazy computation and sophisticated degeneracy detection
- Array-of-structures approach for transforms (informed by robotics messaging experience)
- Orbit camera with separate pan/zoom/rotate controls (NX/3DXpert style)
- Mesh-wide default color initially, sparse vertex colors later
- Phase-based development with clear completion criteria

**Communication Style:**
- Asks for "housecleaning" when they sense architectural misalignment
- Values documentation that enables context switching between Claude instances
- Appreciates when you identify gaps between implementation and design intent
- Wants to understand trade-offs and implications, not just get working code
